#### Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Economics](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/faculty+and+research/departments/ettore+bocconi+dep+of+economics/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/). Prior to joining Bocconi, I obtained my PhD at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/).  My research interests lie primarily in the field of Microeconomic Theory. In particular, I am interested in dynamic problems with evolving information. The main applications of my theoretical research lie in the economics of science, the economics of innovation, and industrial organization more broadly.  I am also interested in empirical work; so far, I have been working on the estimation of auction models, the analysis of merger policy, and the interaction of pricing strategies with online ratings.
